# mongo-url-utils

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/seangarner/mongo-url-utils.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/seangarner/mongo-url-utils)

Utilities to parse url parameters into objects that can be passed to mongo functions.

## compatibility
Currently depends on mongo 2.6 for the eq support.

Tested against node 4 LTS, 6 LTS and 8 LTS.


## example
```js
var mongoUrlUtils = require('mongo-url-utils');

var params = {
  sort: '-age,+firstName',
  fields: '-_id,+email,+firstName',
  limit: '10',
  skip: '0',
  query: 'or(gt(age,18),eq(married,false))'
};

var opts = mongoUrlUtils(params);

collection.find(opts.query, opts, function (err, docs) {
  console.dir(docs);
});
```

The above would yield this `opts` object:
```js
{
  query: {
    $or: [
      { age: { '$gt': 18 } },
      { married: { '$eq': false } },
    ]
  },
  options: {
    sort: {
      age: -1.
      firstName: 1
    },
    fields: {
      _id: 0,
      email: 1,
      firstName: 1
    },
    limit: 10,
    skip: 0
  }
}
```

Or you can parse the query string directly:
```js
mongoUrlUtils('query=gt(age,21)&sort=-age');

// {
//   query: { age: { '$gt': 21 } },
//   options: {
//     sort: { age: -1 }
//   }
// }
```


## `findIn`
Sugar to parse a url or params and pass to mongo `find` method of a collection.  Returns a cursor.
```js
var people = db.collection('people');
mongoUrlUtils.findIn(people, 'query=eq(id,3)').toArray(function (err, docs) {
  // ...
});
```


## `findOneIn`
Sugar to parse a url or params and pass to mongo `findOne` method of a collection.
```js
var people = db.collection('people');
mongoUrlUtils.findOneIn(people, 'query=eq(id,3)', function (err, person) {
  // ...
});
```


## find operators
A find string is made up of any of the `query`, `sort`, `fields`, `limit` and `skip` operators.


### `query`
A query string which when parsed builds a query object for find.  Coverage of the mongo query
interface isn't 100% implemented yet.  Here's what's available:

operator    | example
----------- | -------------
$eq         | `eq(name,"West and Sons")`
$gte        | `gte(id,6)`
$gt         | `gt(id,6)`
$lte        | `lte(id,3)`
$lt         | `lt(id,3)`
$ne         | `ne(closed,true)`
$size       | `size(grades,4)`
$in         | `in(restaurant_id,["8165423","5827429"])`
$nin        | `nin(id,[1,2,3,4,5])`
$all        | `all(address.coord,["-47.9327","-82.6261"])`
$and        | `and(eq(grades.score,5),eq(borough,"Buckinghamshire"))`
$or         | `or(eq(id,1),eq(borough,"Buckinghamshire"))`
$not        | `not(size(grades,0))`
$regex      | `regex(address.street,".*Road.*")`
$where      | `where("parseInt(this.restaurant_id, 10) === 5827429")`
$text       | `text("y hijos", "es")`
$mod        | `mod(id,5,1)`
$elemMatch  | `elemMatch(grades,eq(score,2))`
$exists     | `exists(closed,false)`
$type       | `type(name,2)` or `type(name,String)` (see Mongo Types)
$comment    | `comment("A23"),eq(name,"West and Sons")` or `eq(name,"West and Sons"),comment("A23")`

Example; only return people who are widowed or age is greater than 50 and less than 70.
```
GET /people?query=or(eq(widowed,true),and(gt(age,50),lt(age,70)))
```

There are also extra operators that wrap `$regex` providing a more predictable query without the
full power or danger associated with PCREs.

operator    | example
----------- | ----------------------------------
startsWith  | `startsWith(name, "We")`
endsWith    | `endsWith(address.street, "Road")`
contains    | `contains(borough, "shire")`

The extra operators also support `$not`.  For example `not(contains(borough, "shire"))` would
find the docs in which `borough` does not contain `shire`.

#### data type support

In addition to the string, number, boolean and `null` types, the query parser implements support for native Date parsing.

type | format | parsed as  | example usage
-----|--------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------
date | [Date Time String][ecma-datetime] | [Date][mdn-date]  | `gt(grades.date,Date(2015-04-28T17:00Z))`

Please submit pull requests for additional data types, particularly those that are found within the [MongoDB Extended JSON](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/mongodb-extended-json/) specification.

#### case insensitive matching
Some operators support the `i` flag to denote that the operator should match the value case
insensitively.  This is useful if you want to enable case insensitive match without allowing
full `$regex` powers (because `$regex` is the only way of achieving this in mongo).

  - `eq(tags, 'NODE', i)` matches Node, NODE, node, NoDe, etc

Also supported with `ne`, `startsWith`, `endsWith` and `contains`, but must be enabled using the
`disabledOperators` query option as the default is to disable this feature.

```js
var options = {
  query: {
    caseInsensitiveOperators: true
  }
};
mongoUrlUtils({query: 'regex(email,"Person@Example.Com",i)'}, options);
```

#### regex safety checking
The `regex` query operator can be dangerous allowing attackers to create an expensive expression.
Set `safeRegex` to `true` to pass all regexes through [safe-regex](https://github.com/substack/safe-regex)
and throw an error if an unsafe regex is sent.

```js
var options = {
  query: {
    safeRegex: true
  }
};
mongoUrlUtils({query: 'regex(email,"(a+){10}y")'}, options);
// throws Error
```

#### mongo types
The `type()` query operator allows either integer identifiers as per the mongodb documentation.  For
convinience it also maps the following types to their ids: `Double`, `String`, `Object`, `Array`,
`Binary`, `Undefined`, `ObjectId`, `Boolean`, `Date`, `Null`, `RegExp`, `Javascript`, `Symbol`,
`ScopedJavascript`, `Int32`, `Timestamp` and `Int64`.

#### todo
  - full `$not` support
    - missing for `regex`, `where`, `text`, `mod`, `elemMatch`, `exists`, `type`
  - $nor
  - /regex/ (can't use $regex with $in/$nin)


### `sort`
Comma separated field names prefixed with a `+` for an ascending sort or `-` for a descending sort.
There is no default so either `-` or `+` must be provided.

Example; return people sorted by oldest age first.

```
GET /people?sort=-age
```

### `fields`
A [projection parameter](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/db.collection.find) which
limits which fields are returned.  Fields are comma separated.

You can either use an inclusive *or*  exclusive projection.  An inclusive (`+`) projection means
give me back only these fields.  An exclusive (`-`) projection means give me back all fields except
these.  Inclusive and exclusive cannot be mixed, with one exception for the `_id` field in an
inclusive projection.

Example; only return the first name and country of people and exclude `_id`.  This is the only
time you can mix `-` and `+`.

```
GET /people?fields=-_id,+firstName,+address.country
```

The following projection operators are also supported:

operator               | example
---------------------- | ----------------------------------
[elemMatch-projection] | `elemMatch(students,eq(school,102))`

Projection operators can be mixed with projection parameters, however it's difficult to prevent
mixed exclusive and exclusive parameters with operators so it's recommended that operators come last
in the fields string.  e.g.

```
GET /courses?fields=-id,+title,elemMatch(students,eq(gender,"female"))
```

### `limit`
Limit how many documents are returned.

Example; return at most the first 10 documents.
```
GET /people?limit=10
```

### `skip`
How many documents to skip before returning the set.  When combined with `limit` it can be used to
page results.

Example; return all except the first 10 documents.
```
GET /people?skip=10
```

## disabling query operators
Perhaps you don't want to allow all query operators for performance reasons.  It's possible to
disable operators at the parser level so the parser will throw an exception when a blacklisted
operator is used.

Example; disable the regex operator.
```js
var options = {
  query: {
    disabledOperators: ['regex', 'text']
  }
};
mongoUrlUtils({query: 'regex(email,".*\\\\.gmail\\\\.com")'}, options);

// Error: regex operator is disabled
```

### a note on URL encoding
Browsers don't encode a literal `+` in the query string of a url but node will convert them into
literal spaces when parsing the querystring.  This is a little inconvenient for `sort` and `fields`
which both prefix fields with `+`.  Both parsers works around this by treating a literal space as it
would a `+` at the beginning of the query value.

If this magic behavior concerns you it can be disabled by setting the `{strictEncoding: true}`
option - but remember clients are now responsible for encoding `+` before making the request.

```js
var options = {
  strictEncoding: true
};
mongoUrlUtils('fields=+id,-_id', options); // throws an Error
mongoUrlUtils('fields=%2Bid,-_id', options); // works as expected
```
